              <h4>How To Become A Self-Taught Web Developer</h4>
              <p>I started like most in the industry, with free resources like Freecodecamp, Codecademy and Youtube. However, I soon stumbled upon Udemy. Such a great platform and yet I only discovered it last year. Better late than never!
                I enrolled in a course called The Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele. Honestly, this is when I properly started my journey. While ‘Freecodecamp’ and ‘Codecademy’ were okay for a start, they were not sufficient for a total noob like me. Unlike with the Colt Steele online course, he assumes his students know absolutely nothing about web development. Later in the course, it moves into more advanced stuff. In the course, we eventually built a big project, called YelpCamp, which makes use of both front-end and back-end technologies. (Unless he made updates, that’s how the course was when I took it). We covered ‘ME_N stack’ in this course. </p>

              <h4>15 Web Developer Portfolios to Inspire You</h4>
              <p>Putting together a top notch web developer portfolio is a crucial part of getting hired as a web developer. And it’s a particularly important tool when you don’t have a ton of paid experience (yet!). Absolutely any project you’ve done qualifies for a spot in your web developer portfolio (whether it was done for pay or simply professional development), meaning you’ll have a way to show companies and clients what you can do no matter where you are on your career path.
              We’ve written about sites where you can host your portfolio content, how to build your own portfolio website, and what kind of projects should be in your portfolio…but how exactly should those projects be presented?
              To give you some inspiration on ways you can bring your website and app projects to life in a web developer portfolio setting, we’ve put together a checklist of things you need to include in your web developer portfolio AND rounded up 15 web developer portfolio examples. Mix and match the ideas you see here, and you’re bound to piece together the perfect way to present your own work.</p>

In fact, your domain name needs to be relevant to your brand (think keywords!), recognizable by your target audience, and of course, available.
              That’s why utilizing a reliable domain name generator when it comes to naming your website is so helpful. Today we’re going to take a look at what a domain name generator is and which ones you should be using when it comes to naming your website.</p>
